#About 
Python scripts for Audio Signal Processing. The implementations include dynamic range compression (based on bands of a signal), noise gating, attack amplification, wave field synthesis convolution of signals, and a spectral centroid equalization.

#Dependencies
Dependencies include SMS-Tools (install it via pip looking for smst package), NumPy, SciPy, pyolib objects and Essentia algorithms. This repo includes a sine.py module like the one of smst package, but coded for multiband analysis of a signal and using python language as much as possible.

#coded by
All code written by Marcelo Tuller (a.k.a. Mars Crop)
